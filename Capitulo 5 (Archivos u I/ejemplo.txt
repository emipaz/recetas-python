5.1. Reading and Writing Text Data
Problem
You need to read or write text data, possibly in different text encodings such as ASCII,
UTF-8, or UTF-16.
Solution
Use the open() function with mode rt to read a text file. For example:
# Read the entire file as a single string
with open('somefile.txt', 'rt') as f:
data = f.read()
# Iterate over the lines of the file
with open('somefile.txt', 'rt') as f:
for line in f:
# process line
